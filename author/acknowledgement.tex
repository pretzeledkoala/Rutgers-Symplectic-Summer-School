\extrachap{Acknowledgements}

From August 19 to August 23, Rutgers University ran a summer school on symplectic geometry that aimed to provide graduate students and advanced undergraduate students tutorials in various advanced topics in symplectic geometry and introductions to recent developments. This year was focused on, but was not restricted to, the foundational aspects, including the theory of global Kuranishi charts, integer-valued curve-counting invariants, Hamiltonian dynamics, and contact topology.
